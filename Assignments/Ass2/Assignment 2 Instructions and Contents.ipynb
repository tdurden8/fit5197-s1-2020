    "3. <span style=\"color:green\">These questions are meant for you to solve independently, we encourage students to figure out the questions themselves as it would be good for their understandings of the topics; however, please feel free to consult your tutors if needed. Plagiarism (either from using online sources or copying the answers from your classmates) will be penalised accordingly.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. <span style=\"color:green\">Requests for special consideration or extension must be submitted at least 2 days BEFORE THE DEADLINE. The due date is on Sunday, so the latest day you can ask for extension is on Friday (the last official working day of the week for the teaching team). Please follow Monash guidelines to request for extensions (medical certificates, doctor or GP letter, etc). Emergencies are to be adjusted individually.</span>\n",

    "13. <span style=\"color:green\">This assignment has 10 marks for presentation, this includes presenting your explanation in **Markdown**, writing and commenting on code efficiently, creating good plots with clear labels on the axis, etc.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "14. <span style=\"color:green\">Only answers with correct methodology will be considered for consequential marks. Meaning if you attempt the question and your answer is incorrect, but your methodology is correct, you will still receive partial marks for subsequent questions. However, answers with incorrect methodology (misunderstanding the questions) will generate no marks for subsequent questions.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "15. <span style=\"color:green\">Challenge questions are for students aiming to get a HD for the assignment. We don't advise for students to spend time on these questions before finishing all the other parts in the assignment. This assignment is designed in a way that students can get up to 80 (HD) without attempting the challenge questions.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. <span style=\"color:red\">Please don’t send emails to tutors asking for suggestions, we have Moodle and consultations for that. When writing your inquiries on Moodle please try to be clear in your problem and not revealing your working to others as this might be counted as plagiarism on your part. A good format for inquiry topic would be e.g. “Assignment 2 – Tutorial 10 (your tutorial slot) – Question about median\"</span>\n",

    "2. <span style=\"color:red\">Handwritten answers incur a penalty of 10% on your assignment, you have Markdown, please learn how to use it as it will be an useful skill for you going through the degree as well as in real life situation.</span>\n",

    "3. This assignment will contribute towards 20% of your total score.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Late submission is 5% per day, after 10 days you will be given no marks. Late submission is calculated as follows: If you get 70% on this assignment and you are late for 2 days (you submit on Tuesday), your score is now 70% -10% (2x5% per day) = 60%. This is done to ensure that the teaching team can release your result as soon as possible so that you can review on your mistakes and have a better study experience.\n",
